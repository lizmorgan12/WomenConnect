#### Total Headcount goal: 120 external attendees, 25 internal employees (i.e. 20 WomenConnect facilitators, 5 event volunteers)

---
### Event Agenda (long version)
#### Kick off speech - 5 minutes

- The kick off speech is usually delivered by the event host (typically an engineering WIT Leader) The kick off speech includes a welcome and overview of the event agenda. In addition, the speaker provides an overview of your company's commitment to diversity and inclusion/WIT initiatives and the impact they have at your company

#### Keynote Speaker - 15 minutes

- Keynote Speaker is a mid to senior level engineering leader. This person is a representative of your company's commitment to hiring and developing a diverse and inclusive work culture
- Keynotes Speakers often talk about their personal stories related to inclusion, career transformation, overcoming personal or professional obstacles, or providing overviews of a product or initiative that was built by a diverse team.

#### Dinner and Table Discussions - 1 hour

- WomenConnect Speakers and Facilitators will sit 2 to a table, with 8-10 external attendees. Women Connect Facilitators are responsible for driving and facilitating  table discussions, which will allow them to hear first-hand some of the successes and obstacles attendees  encounter in the workplace. This is a critical role in the event’s success. All facilitators will receive questions and prompts to help keep the conversation flowing and keep all attendees included and engaged in dialogue. One of the facilitators should take notes throughout the discussion in preparation to share best practices or key points with the broader group at the end of the evening.

#### Table Discussion Sharing - 30 minutes

- A WomenConnect host, speaker or facilitator will ask each table to take a turn and share key points and best practices from their table discussions  with the broader group. 

#### Networking (until close) - 30 minutes

- WomenConnect saves the best for last - networking! After the attendees have had a chance to meet and create rapport with each other, the networking portion of the event is scheduled towards the end - so attendees have a chance to continue the conversation

### Roles & Responsibilities
![img](http://i.cubeupload.com/PlzIS2.png)

---

### WomenConnect Facilitators
WomenConnect Facilitators will sit two to a table with 8-10 event attendees and encourage the engagement of attendees in meaningful conversation. This is a critical role in the event’s success. Facilitators are responsible for driving discussions, which will allow them to hear first-hand some of the successes and obstacles our employees encounter in the workplace. All facilitators will receive questions and prompts to help keep the conversation flowing and keep all attendees included and engaged in dialogue.

---

### Key best practices for successful facilitation:

- Kick off the table discussion with assurance that this is a safe place for discussion
- Have each person introduce themselves, their position/team & length of time at their current employer
- Ensure everyone at your table is comfortable and included in contributing to the conversation
- Validate the feedback and opinions shared by attendees
- Offer a positive perspective on workplace challenges that are discussed

---
### WomenConnect Facilitator Selection
The WomenConnect Host, in partnership with the Event Program Manager, will identify appropriate employees to participate in the WomenConnect event as a facilitator. 

WomenConnect Facilitators should meet the following criteria:

- Minimum of 7 years of industry experience 

- Ideally, currently holding an engineering leadership position (i.e. Manager, Sr Manager, Director, VP). Individual contributors (ICs) in engineering are also eligible, but they must have 7 years of experience & experience in mentoring junior employees.

- Facilitators should be a mix of men and women with women always making up more than half of the total number of facilitators

---
### WomenConnect Facilitators should meet the following criteria (continued):
- Always pair a male facilitator with a female facilitator, or put a female facilitator on her own to lead a table provided she’s in a senior role and/or has previous WomenConnect experience. 

- If this is not possible, the most senior male facilitators may lead a table on their own

- Diversify organization representation - facilitators should come from various technical disciplines and engineering teams (i.e Engineering, Test, UX, TPM, Product Management, Applications, Infrastructure, Mobile, etc …)

---

### WomenConnect Facilitator Discussion Topics

Below is a sample of questions that can be used as facilitator discussion topics. Printed copies should be given to the facilitators at the event. These are to be leveraged as conversation starters, and no questions are mandatory.

- Have you experienced a career transformation? (note: transformations can be large and small, be sure to emphasize this) How did it happen? What worked well? What is the advice you would give someone else looking for a career transformation? What are some of the challenges you faced?  

- If you could do your career over again, what would you have done differently?

- How have you grown/developed your leadership skills? What advice do you have for others around the table looking to develop their leadership skills?

- What is an example of a time when you failed? What did you take away from it?

- Do you have a professional “aha” moment? What made it so special? What did you learn and what changes did you make, if any?

- Share some of the challenges you’ve faced throughout your career to date. What are some solutions you have implemented to mitigate these challenges? (note: Some women will be early in their career and some later. You might want to have them distinguish at what point during their career this happened.)

- How do you balance work and home life? Do you have tips or advice to share on setting boundaries or expectations with others?

- What techniques or tips do you have in building out your strategic network and relationships? How do you nurture and leverage them?

- Who are the people in your life that have inspired you? What skills and behaviors do they have and how might you learn from them?

### Talent Acquisition	
Your recruiting partners play a significant role in identifying potential attendees for your event and nurturing this pool of talent with the goal of creating a long-term pipeline for hiring. In addition, recruiting will also play a critical role in answering questions related to job opportunities and cultivating a community for future events and hiring.
#### Research
Recruiting responsibilities are to identify potential attendees for your event program via the following sources:
- LinkedIn
- Employee recommendations
- Internet research

#### Recruiting
Although the event is not recruiting focused, by default you will have attendees interested in finding out about job opportunities from the company sponsoring the event. Your recruiting partner(s) should attend the event as a volunteer. The event host should recognize the recruiters presence by highlighting this person as a resource to answer questions about job opportunities.
#### Community
Post event, recruiting should build community and a platform for ongoing communication about future events and dialogue between attendees that made professional connections during the event. In addition, it’s recommended recruiting create a confidential community or way to house the list of identified prospects for upcoming events.

### Sample Event Budget*	

| Item  |  Expense         | 
| ------------- |:--------:|
| Swag      | $2000 |
| Name Tags     | $100 |
| Event Signs | $100 |
| Catering | $4,500 | 
|  Total | $6,200 | 

*This reflects the budget for an event of approx. 120 people

---
### Venue and Catering

**Event Planning:** To have sufficient time in planning an amazing event, it is recommended you start 90 - 120 days before the event date

**Venue:** The Event Project Manager will need to identify a venue or space at your company campus that can fit approx. 120 people comfortably at round tables (ideally, there’s also projection capability). Round tables are highly encouraged for the table discussions portion of the event. There should also be plenty of space for standing networking time and an entrance where you can setup a check-in area. 

---

### Catering
Typically, a seated, plated dinner is served at WomenConnect. However, if you are managing a conservative budget, buffet style dinner can be another option. If possible, setup the food “family-style” (on the table) as to prevent any disruption of flow from the conversations. 
For an afternoon session, an assortment of appetizers is recommended. Please be sure to vary the menu to meet all dietary restrictions. 
For an evening session, you can serve heavy appetizers or, ideally, dinner. In addition, hiring a bartender and waiters for the event is a great option to serve beverages and service the attendees. If possible, ask that waiters/catering attendants are available to keep the food fresh and pour drinks throughout the room during table conversations.

---

### Event Invitation 

You can choose any online invitation company to create and send out your invitations. 

WomenConnect Host, Event Program Manager and Project Manager write invitation verbiage that highlights the following:

- Goal of the event
- Date, time and location
- Agenda outline
- Host/speaker bios and pictures
- Key selling points on why someone should attend
- Special instructions (i.e, parking, directions) 

After your invitation is created, please request the list of potential attendees and contact information from your TA partner. 

Invitations should be sent out 4 weeks prior to the event. 

Invitation reminder schedule:
- 2 weeks prior to event
- 2 days prior to event

Allow for at least 30% over maximum capacity for attendee RSVP’s as you will have drop off close to or on the day of the event

---
### Planning Logistics
- **Extra Laptop.** Use your discretion to decide if you’ll need to rent an extra laptop or leverage the laptop/s of your volunteers for the check-in of attendees. Keep in mind, one laptop will be needed to project the backdrop slide for the full duration of the event.
- **Name Tags.** Prepare each name tag with the names of the WomenConnect attendees in one color and the names of the facilitators/speakers/volunteers in a different color. You could also add your company logo to the name tags for employee attendees. Print a few extra blank tags of each color in case any guests or facilitators join the day of the event. Print and tear the name tags, place into the casing, and bring them to the venue day of to be setup on the check-in table.
- **Event Backdrop Slide.** Create a backdrop slide to be projected in the background for the duration of the event.

- **Calendar Invites (speakers and facilitators only).** As soon as the speakers and facilitators have been selected, send them a calendar invite with the location and specific time you need them to arrive. Speakers will have their own invitation while the facilitators can be grouped together in a single invite. Please ask host, speakers, and facilitators to arrive 1 hour early. Monitor the responses to be sure everyone has confirmed.
- **Event Signage.** Create event sign(s) to direct your attendees to your venue the day of the event.

- **Check-in attendee template.** Create a spreadsheet to check in your attendees the day of the event. Your check-in data should include name, email and company affiliation. In addition to receiving a name tag, the event check in volunteer will also let the attendee know which table they will be seated at for dinner. Lastly, you also have the option of requesting if they are interested in hearing about job opportunities upon checking in.

- **Facilitator Table Arrangement.** Facilitators will sit two per each table. Try to seat facilitators at tables and with attendees that will correspond to their profession or technical background (i.e. the mobile, infrastructure, test, “Product table,” an “Engineering Table, etc.). With last-minute drop-offs, this likely won’t work out perfectly, so just do the best you can.

- **Host, Speakers and Facilitator Reminder Email.** Two days before the event, send the host, speakers and facilitators a reminder email (template) about their role, responsibilities and inform them of their table pairs. 

- **Print Facilitator Discussion Cards.** Print the facilitator questions onto cardstock paper. Print in landscape view and divide the paper in two columns so you can print two cards per page. 

- **Create Table Numbers.** Upon arrival, women will be told which table number they’re assigned. To make this easier, create table tents with a table number upright on both sides of the tent to place at each table.

---

### WomenConnect Event Swag

* Swag can be purchased through your company’s preferred vendor or another brand merchandise store
* Some examples include [Women In Tech book](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Tech-Practical-Inspiring-Stories-ebook/dp/B010ZZYJSI), stemless wine glasses, tea cup & saucer, company-branded leather bound notebooks
* On the day of the event, swag can be provided to attendees upon arrival, departure or at roundtables.


_Note: Don’t forget to think about packaging of the giveaway item! If the vendor can ship the swag individually pre-wrapped (such as in a box), it can save a lot of time, but you’d also save money by wrapping items yourself!_
